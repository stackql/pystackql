# Error patterns for centralized error detection in PyStackQL
#
# This file defines patterns that should be detected as errors when they appear
# in query results. These patterns are checked against messages returned in stdout
# to identify error conditions that would otherwise be treated as valid data.
#
# Pattern Types:
# - fuzzy_matches: Substring matching (case-insensitive)
# - exact_matches: Exact string matching (case-sensitive)

errors:
  # Fuzzy matches - will match if the pattern appears anywhere in the message
  fuzzy_matches:
    # HTTP error status codes (4xx client errors, 5xx server errors)
    - "http response status code: 4"
    - "http response status code: 5"

    # StackQL-specific error patterns from stackql-deploy
    - "disparity in fields"
    - "cannot find matching operation"

    # Additional StackQL error patterns
    - "invalid query"
    - "syntax error"

  # Exact matches - must match the entire message or start with this prefix
  exact_matches:
    - "error:"
    - "ERROR:"
    - "Error:"
    - "FAILED"
    - "FAILURE"
